	/* Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return
	the k closest points to the origin (0, 0). The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean
	distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2). You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be
	unique (except for the order that it is in).

	Example 1:
	Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
	Output: [[-2,2]]
	Explanation:
	The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
	The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
	Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
	We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].

	Example 2:
	Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
	Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
	Explanation: The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.

	Constraints:
	1 <= k <= points.length <= 104
	-10^4 <= xi, yi <= 10^4 */
